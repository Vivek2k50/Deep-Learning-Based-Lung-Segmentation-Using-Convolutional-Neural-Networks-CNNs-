Lung Segmentation Project:
This project focuses on lung segmentation using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with the Keras Sequential API. The CNN is designed to process medical images and accurately segment lung regions from CT scans or X-ray images.
Training and Evaluation:
The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function, then trained over 50 epochs.
Post-training, the modelâ€™s performance is assessed using accuracy, confusion matrix, and a classification report, providing insights into how well the model segments lung areas.
Key Features
Deep CNN Architecture: Designed to learn and capture complex patterns in medical images for precise lung segmentation.
Regularization: Utilizes batch normalization and dropout to enhance model stability and prevent overfitting.
Evaluation: Detailed metrics like confusion matrix and classification report ensure thorough performance analysis, critical in medical imaging tasks.
This CNN model aims to facilitate accurate and efficient lung segmentation, which is a crucial step in medical diagnosis and treatment planning.
